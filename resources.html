                        <p class="card-text">Donating blood offers several health benefits. It can lower the risk of
                            heart disease by reducing iron levels, which helps protect the heart and blood vessels.
                            Blood donation also promotes better blood flow, lowers cancer risks associated with high
                            iron, and supports liver health. By stimulating new blood cell production, it maintains
                            healthy blood levels and boosts immunity. Donors experience mental health benefits, too, as
                            helping others fosters a sense of purpose. Additionally, donation centers provide free
                            health screenings, offering insights into your overall well-being.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">To be eligible for blood donation, donors must generally be at least 17
                            years old, weigh at least 110 pounds (50 kg), and be in good health. Donors should not have
                            any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease or active infections. Itâ€™s important
                            to have no recent history of high-risk behaviors or certain travel histories. Eligibility
                            also depends on the frequency of previous donations, with guidelines for how often you can
                            donate based on the type of blood product. Donors are typically screened for iron levels and
                            other factors before donation.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">There are several types of blood donations, each serving different medical
                            needs. Whole blood donation is the most common, where all components of blood are collected.
                            Platelet donation focuses on collecting only platelets, which help in clotting and are
                            essential for cancer patients and those with blood disorders. Plasma donation involves
                            collecting the liquid portion of blood, which is used for patients with liver disease,
                            burns, or trauma. Additionally, double red cell donations specifically collect red blood
                            cells, vital for treating patients with anemia or major surgeries. Each type of donation
                            plays a critical role in saving lives.</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Facts & Tips for Donors</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">For a smooth blood donation experience, it's important to stay hydrated and
                            eat a healthy meal before donating. Avoid caffeine or fatty foods, as they can affect the
                            donation process. Wear comfortable clothing with sleeves that can be easily rolled up. After
                            donating, rest for a few minutes and enjoy a snack to replenish your energy. It's also
                            essential to follow any specific instructions provided by the donation center, such as
                            waiting between donations and knowing your eligibility. Donating blood is safe and
                            beneficial, and every donation has the potential to save multiple lives.</p>
